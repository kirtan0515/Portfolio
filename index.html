                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Kirtan Patel, a Computer & Information Sciences student at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. My passion for technology led me to a role as a Code Sensei at Code Ninjas, where I combined my love for technology, video games, and teaching to create a fun and safe learning environment for kids aged 7-14. I've dedicated myself to making complex concepts accessible and exciting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also had the pleasure of leading the Computer Club, where I trained students on software programs and invited industry professionals for knowledge sharing sessions. My hands-on experience in the field is complemented by my academic background, which includes a range of coursework from programming and computer architecture to system design and discrete mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not just about academics and work, though. I've also competed in the AAA Hack4design event, where I collaborated with a team to design an innovative digital experience. On the technical side, I am certified in NLP with Python for Machine Learning, a testament to my capabilities in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). This certification, issued by LinkedIn in April 2023, further enriches my skill set and positions me to leverage these skills in real-world applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm fluent in Java, Python, and web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS, and I have experience with a variety of software, databases, operating systems, and frameworks. Moreover, I'm comfortable communicating in English, Hindi, and Gujarati.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding or teaching, you can find me exploring the latest video games or brushing up on my hacking skills through my ethical hacking certification from Udemy. I'm always eager to learn and look forward to the opportunity to bring my unique blend of skills and passion to new challenges.
                </p>
